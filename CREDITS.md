# Credits & Attribution

azimuth is an **API consumer** of [WorldMonitor](https://api.worldmonitor.app) (Path A — no
source fork). It transforms WorldMonitor's open-intelligence API responses into a derived,
HemySphere-pattern public vault. No upstream source code is copied or modified.

Every surfaced data subset is registered in [`sources/registry.json`](sources/registry.json)
and validated by the per-source license guardrail (`scripts/check_sources.py`) before it can
be surfaced. Each credit line below is tagged with its registry `key` so the credit ↔ registry
join stays machine-checkable.

## Primary aggregator

- **WorldMonitor** — `api.worldmonitor.app` — public API aggregator. Upstream project
  [`koala73/worldmonitor`](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor) is AGPL-3.0 + commercial
  dual-licensed; pure API-consumer use does not trigger AGPL (no fork, no modified service).

## Staged sources (registered, NOT yet surfaced — pending per-source license review)

These are present in the registry with `surfaced: false`, each carrying a `surfaced_reason`.
Under the fact-vs-propaganda editorial line (Michael 2026-06-24) they are **factual** channels
— so none is held on editorial grounds. The hold is **license** (or, for `positive-events`,
the news per-source fact-filter; for `giving-index`, derived-composite). Each becomes
surfaceable the moment a clean free-to-use license / clean source path is confirmed and a
`CREDITS.md` line is added in the same PR:

- `conflict-events-acled` — ACLED — held: ACLED ToU restricts redistribution (UCDP is the surfaced clean-licensed alternative).
- `vessel-tracking-ais` — AIS aggregators — held: AIS-aggregator license commercial/unknown (NGA navigational warnings are the surfaced clean maritime channel).
- `military-flights-adsb` / `gps-interference` — ADS-B Exchange — held: restrictive/commercial upstream license.
- `market-equities` — Yahoo Finance — held: proprietary-with-fair-use (crypto via CoinGecko is the surfaced clean market channel).
- `bigmac-index` — The Economist — held: proprietary index dataset.
- `comtrade-flows` — UN Comtrade — held: redistribution-restricted (WTO tariff-trends is the surfaced clean trade channel).
- `webcam-streams` — YouTube live streams — held: per-stream third-party licensing.
- `satellite-imagery` — mixed imagery providers — held: surfaceable once narrowed to Sentinel/Landsat public-domain only.
- `positive-events` — good-news RSS outlets — held: news per-source fact-filter (advocacy outlets, not wire/agency fact-reporting).
- `giving-index` — composite charitable-giving index — held: WorldMonitor-derived analytic composite, not a single raw observed feed.
- `research-feeds` — arXiv + HN + GitHub trending — held: mixed per-item licensing (low priority).
